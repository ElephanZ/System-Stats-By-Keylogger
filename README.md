# System-Stats-By-Keylogger
_Project of Technologies for Advanced Programming_

## Introduction

The course aims to study and use technologies useful to build end-to-end solutions to analyze, manage, store, process, and visualize data acquired in real-time. For instance, we have seen: Docker containers, and pipelines built with Logstash (for data ingestion), Kafka (for data streaming), Spark (for data processing), ElasticSearch (for data storing), and Kibana (for data visualization). 

### Data Source: Windows Keylogger

The data source is a Windows Keylogger :warning: written and used just on my computer for academic purposes. <br/>
It has been developed in C++ and uses Windows APIs. <br/>
It sends a log to the TCP server on each foreground window change OR after 1 minute of user inactivity.

The log has the following pattern:
```
[GUID] :: [Window Title] :: [Timestamp Start]
Text logged...
[Timestamp End]
```

Each log is composed by:
- **GUID**: Identifies the PC univocally. Has the following format: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.
- **Window Title**: Is the title of the window where the user has typed.
- **Text logged**: Is the set of keys pressed by the user and logged by the keylogger.
- **Timestamp Start**: Indicates when the user started typing in that window.
- **Timestamp End**: Indicates when the user finished typing in that window.

For instance:
```
[08E9C0E6-CF7D-43F7-922D-0D6E3B204F8A] :: [Untitled - Notepad] :: [2022-01-01 12:30:00]
Hello Wot[BACKSPACE]rld!
[2022-01-01 12:31:37]

[08E9C0E6-CF7D-43F7-922D-0D6E3B204F8A] :: [Calculator] :: [2022-01-01 12:32:46]
50+50[ENTER]/4
[2022-01-01 12:33:00]
```

### Server System

There is a socket which receives the log and passes it to the pipeline described above and illustrated below:
<p align="center"> <img src="docs/images/pipeline.png?v=1653225037" height="440px"/> </p>

The purpose of the project is to make stats on the use of the system by the user. <br/>
Specifically, the following functions are available:
- For Text Analysis:
    + Frequency statistics about pressed keys :chart_with_upwards_trend:
    + Sentiment analysis :sparkles:
- For Windows and Timestamps:
    + Type of window classification (social, game, utility, others) :iphone:
    + How much time the user spends on each category of windows :eyes:
    + How much time the user spends writing to the PC :clock9:

Additionally, this project was created as an exam project, to test and practice the following skills:
* Knowledge of Docker
* Knowledge of Data Ingestion via Logstash
* Knowledge of Data Streaming via Kafka
* Knowledge of Data Processing via Spark 
* Knowledge of Data Storage via ElasticSearch
* Knowledge of Data Visualization via Kibana
* Knowledge of Jupyter Notebook (for the presentation)
* Good coding skills (legible, reliable, documentation, etc.) :computer:

## Structure

Let's see the structure of the project and how I have used all the components:

Each of the following components used has been put inside a **Docker Container**. <br/>

## Getting Started

So that the repository is successfully cloned and simulator run smoothly, a few steps need to be followed.

### Requisites

* Need to download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
* The use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended.

### Installation and Use

```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/ElephanZ/System-Stats-By-Keylogger.git
   $ cd yourPath/System-Stats-By-Keylogger/
   $ ./run.sh
```
