# System-Stats-By-Keylogger
_Project of Technologies for Advanced Programming_

## Introduction

The course aims to study and use technologies useful to build end-to-end solutions to analyze, manage, store, process, and visualize data acquired in real-time. For instance, we have seen: Docker containers, and pipelines built with Logstash (for data ingestion), Kafka (for data streaming), Spark (for data processing), ElasticSearch (for data storing), and Kibana (for data visualization). 

In this project, I want to apply what I have studied. The data source is a Windows Keylogger (written and used just on my computer for academic purposes) which sends a log each **K** seconds to the server, which receives the log and passes it to the pipeline described above and illustrated below.

Specifically, the following functions are available:
* aaa
* bbb

Additionally, this project was created as an exam project, to test and practice the following skills:
* Knowledge of Docker
* Knowledge of Data Ingestion and Logstash
* Knowledge of Data Streaming and Kafka
* Knowledge of Data Processing and Spark 
* Knowledge of Data Storage and ElasticSearch
* Knowledge of Data Visualization and Kibana
* Knowledge of Jupyter Notebook
* Good coding skills (legible, reliable, etc.)
