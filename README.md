# System-Stats-By-Keylogger
_Project of Technologies for Advanced Programming_

_Antonio Scardace_ @ 
_Dept of Math and Computer Science, University of Catania_

## Introduction

The course aims to study and use technologies useful to build end-to-end solutions to analyze, manage, store, process, and visualize data acquired in real-time. For instance, we have seen: Docker containers, and pipelines built with Logstash (for data ingestion), Kafka (for data streaming), Spark (for data processing), ElasticSearch (for data storing), and Kibana (for data visualization). 

The aim of the project is to make stats on the real-time use of the system by the user (and by users in general). <br/>
Additionally, this project was created as an exam project, to test and practice the following skills:
* Knowledge of Docker
* Knowledge of Data Ingestion via Logstash
* Knowledge of Data Streaming via Kafka
* Knowledge of Data Processing via Spark 
* Knowledge of Data Storing and Indexing via Elasticsearch
* Knowledge of Data Visualization via Kibana
* Knowledge of Jupyter Notebook (for the presentation)
* Good coding skills (legible, reliable, documented, etc.) :computer:

### Data Source: Windows Keylogger

The data source is a Windows Keylogger :warning: written and used just on my computer for academic purposes. <br/>
It has been developed in C++ and uses Windows APIs. <br/>
It sends a log to the TCP server on each foreground window change OR after 1 minute of user inactivity.

The log has the following pattern:
```
[UUID] :: [Window Title] :: [Timestamp Start]
Text logged...
[Timestamp End]
```

Each log is composed by:
- **UUID**: Identifies the PC univocally. Has the following format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.
- **Window Title**: Is the title of the window where the user has typed.
- **Timestamp Start**: Indicates when the user started typing in that window.
- **Text logged**: Is the set of keys pressed by the user and logged by the keylogger.
- **Timestamp End**: Indicates when the user finished typing in that window.

For instance:
```
[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000] :: [Calculator] :: [2022-01-01 12:32:37]
50+50[ENTER]/4[ENTER]-0.456[ENTER]
[2022-01-01 12:33:05]

[00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000] :: [Untitled - Notepad] :: [2022-01-01 12:33:11]
[SHIFT]The ree[BACKSPACE]sult is 24.544
[2022-01-01 12:33:59]
```

### Server System

It receives logs (from multiple clients) and passes them to the pipeline described above and illustrated below:
<p align="center"> <img src="docs/images/pipeline.png?v=1653225037" height="460px"/> </p>

The following functions are available for each user (personal stats) and for all users (general stats):
- For the Text Log:
    + Sentiment analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- For Windows and Timestamps:
    + Type of window classification (social, game, utility, others) :performing_arts:
    + How much time is spent on each category of windows :eyes:
    + How much time is spent writing to the PC :clock9:

## Structure and Demo

Let's see the structure of the project and how I have used all the components:

| <img src="docs/logos/docker-logo.png?v=1653175210" width="165px" /> | Each of the following components used has been put inside a **Docker Container**. |
|-|-|

Component | Utility
------ | -------
<img src="docs/logos/python-logo.png" width="165px" /> | I have used it to implement a multi-threading server that receives real-time logs via TCP requests on the 8800 port from multiple clients. It extracts the features seen above from the logs and saves them in two CSV files: <br/> **metadata.csv** = [UUID, Window Title, Timestamp of Begin, Timestamp of End] <br/> **logs.csv** = [UUID, Text Log] <br/><br/> Here is the UML schema: <br/><p align="center"><img src="docs/images/server-UML.svg"/></p>
<img src="docs/logos/logstash-logo.png" width="165px" /> | **Logstash** is an open-source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice.<br/><br/> I have used it to create two different data flow: one for the metadata and one for the text logs. Logstash takes this input data from two files, metadata.csv and log.csv - they have been shared with the server container via a Docker volume. <br/><br/> Here is an example of what Logstash receives: <br/><br/> <p align="center"> <img src="docs/screens/logstash.png"/> </p>
<img src="docs/logos/kafka-logo.png?v=1653055181" width="165px" /> | **Apache Kafka** is a distributed data streaming platform that can handle and process streams of records in real-time. It is designed to handle data streams from multiple sources and deliver them to numerous consumers. Kafka uses **Zookeeper** to keep track of which partitions each member in a consumer group is consuming, and uses **Brokers** to receive data and send them to customers on request (Kafka has a pull architecture). <br/> Also, we can use **UI for Apache Kafka** which is a simple tool that makes dataflows observable, helps find and troubleshoot issues faster, and deliver optimal performance. <br/><br/> I used it to make a single cluster, which has two topics: one for logs and one for metadata. It receives two different dataflows by Logstash and stores them to be pulled by Spark. **Kafka Stream** has not been used. <br/><br/> <p align="center"> <img src="docs/screens/kafka-ui-0.png"/> <img src="docs/screens/kafka-ui-1.png"/> </p>
<img src="docs/logos/spark-logo.png" width="165px" /> | **Apache Spark** is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing in real-time. It provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Furthermore, it allows us to use **Spark MLlib** which is used to perform machine learning algorithms. <br/><br/> I used it to...
<img src="docs/logos/elasticsearch-logo.png" width="165px" /> | **Elasticsearch** is a search engine, and is the heart of the ELK Stack. It centrally stores data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.<br/><br/> I used it to...
<img src="docs/logos/kibana-logo.png?v=1653055181" width="165px" /> | **Kibana** is a free front-end application that sits on top of the ELK Stack, providing search and data visualization capabilities for data indexed in ElasticSearch. Commonly known as the charting tool for the ELK Stack, Kibana also acts as the UI for monitoring and managing.<br/><br/> I used it to...
